# Technical Documentation Page

This is Project 3/5 in the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.

The project asks you to create a technical documentation page, which includes a navigation bar and multiple sections detailing different aspects of a specific topic. Each section should include headers, paragraphs, code examples, and lists. The page is designed to be responsive and accessible, with a sticky navigation bar on the left side of the screen on larger devices.
