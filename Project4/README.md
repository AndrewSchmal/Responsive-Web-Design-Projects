# Product Landing Page

This is Project 4/5 in the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.

The project asks you to create a product landing page that showcases a product or service. The page includes a header with navigation links, an embedded video, and a form for users to sign up with their email. The page is styled using CSS, with a focus on responsive design, including media queries and flexbox for layout.
