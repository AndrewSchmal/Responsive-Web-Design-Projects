# Tribute Page

This is Project 2/5 in the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.

The project asks you to create a tribute page dedicated to a notable person or subject. The page should include a title, an image with a caption, and detailed information about the subject. The page should be structured using semantic HTML elements and styled to ensure responsiveness.
