# Personal Portfolio Webpage

This is Project 5/5 in the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.

The project asks you to create a personal portfolio webpage that showcases your projects, skills, and contact information. The page includes a welcome section, a projects section with links to your work, and a navigation bar that allows easy access to different sections of the page. The portfolio is designed to be fully responsive, with media queries and a sticky navigation bar.
