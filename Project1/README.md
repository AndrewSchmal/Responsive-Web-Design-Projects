# Survey Form

This is Project 1/5 in the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.

The project asks you to create a survey form that collects user information such as name, email, age, and opinions on various topics. The form includes multiple input fields, dropdown menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a submit button, all styled using custom CSS.
