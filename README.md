# Responsive Web Design Projects

Welcome to my Responsive Web Design Projects repository! ðŸš€

## About This Repository

This repository contains the five projects from the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course. I was assigned a lot of freeCodeCamp content via my Web Application Design and Development class, and I figured while I was at it, I would complete the original assignments and push them all to my GitHub. For extra practice, I'm enhancing and customizing them with additional features, styles, and functionality.

This is a work in progress (WIP) as I'm actively balancing this work with other coursework and commitments. So it may look a bit rough here for a while, but when I am closer to completion, I will go through the whole repo and tidy everything up.

## Projects

1. **Survey Form**
2. **Tribute Page**
3. **Technical Documentation Page**
4. **Product Landing Page**
5. **Personal Portfolio Webpage**

Each project has its own folder containing the necessary files, along with a `README.md` that describes the project and provides a link to the original freeCodeCamp assignment.

## Future Enhancements

*TBD* (To Be Determined)
